# Red Team Labs — Offensive Security Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is my **Red Team lab portfolio**, focused on **offensive security**, adversary simulation, and hands-on technical writeups.

The goal is to document practical labs and real-world style scenarios in a structured way — similar to how a professional red team operator documents internal findings.

---

## Goals

This repository is designed to demonstrate skills in:

- Recon and enumeration methodology
- Exploitation workflows (lab-based)
- Privilege escalation (Windows / Linux)
- Post-exploitation and persistence concepts (ethical labs only)
- Web security testing (OWASP-style)
- Active Directory fundamentals (lab environments)
- Report writing and technical communication

---

## How This Repository Works

This repo is a **container** for multiple labs and writeups.

Each lab has its own folder and its own `README.md`, containing:

- The target / scenario
- The methodology used
- The exploitation path (step-by-step)
- Evidence (screenshots, logs, outputs)
- Lessons learned
- Defensive takeaways (when applicable)

---

## Tools & Topics

Labs in this repository may include:

* Linux & Windows exploitation fundamentals
* Web pentesting
* Burp Suite workflows
* Nmap / enumeration methodology
* Basic exploit development notes (safe + educational)
* Password security concepts (hashing, cracking in lab)
* CTF-style challenges and writeups

---

## Status

This repository is continuously updated with new labs and writeups.

Each folder represents a new offensive security case study.

---

## Disclaimer

This repository is for **educational purposes only**.

All labs are performed in legal environments (CTFs, training platforms, local VMs, or authorized test targets).

No real-world unauthorized access, malware, or illegal activity is supported.
